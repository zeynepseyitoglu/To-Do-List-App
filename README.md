# Task Forest-Zeynep's List
This is a project made for module Java and Web Development for IU International University of Applied Sciences.
## About the app:
Task Forest is an easy-to-use, super simple task app.
Working as a visual online planner, it will help you facilitate your everyday life. You can create and update tasks, check them when they are done, and delete them when they no longer serve. 
With its built-in Pomodoro timer, you can set your desired focus and break times. The app will also keep track of your focus sessions, so youâ€™ll know exactly how many sessions of work you did. The alarm at the end of each session will alert you.
## Features:
- Create, delete, and update tasks as needed.
- Set the timer to the desired minutes.
- Restore the timer to its default state.
- Have a little fun treat with the confetti.
